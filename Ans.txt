This guide breaks down the core concepts of ethical hacking from the sources into easy-to-understand **2-mark (short)** and **5-mark (medium)** answers.

### **Part 1: Short Answers (2-Mark Style)**

These are designed to be quick, punchy, and easy to memorize.

*   **Security Types:** There are six main areas: Network, Application, Information/Data, Cloud, Endpoint, and Physical security [1].
*   **Ethical Hacking:** This is the **legal and authorized** practice of testing systems to find and fix security weaknesses before bad actors can exploit them [1].
*   **DoS Attack (Denial of Service):** An attack that crashes or slows down a system by flooding it with too much traffic, making it unavailable to real users [1, 2].
*   **The CIA Triad:** The foundation of security: **Confidentiality** (privacy), **Integrity** (accuracy), and **Availability** (accessibility) [2].
*   **Asset:** Anything of value to a company, including data, hardware, software, or even their reputation [3].
*   **Vulnerability vs. Threat:** A **vulnerability** is a weakness (like a weak password), while a **threat** is the danger that might exploit it (like a hacker) [4].
*   **Risk vs. Exploit:** **Risk** is the chance a threat will happen; an **exploit** is the actual tool or method used to take advantage of a weakness [4].
*   **Penetration Testing (Pen Test):** A simulated, authorized cyberattack used to check how secure a system really is [5].
*   **VA vs. Pen Testing:** **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)** just finds weaknesses using automated tools; **Pen Testing** actually tries to exploit them to see the real impact [5].
*   **White-Box Testing:** A test where the hacker is given **full knowledge** of the system, including its source code and architecture [6].
*   **OWASP:** An organization that provides free guidelines and tools specifically for **web application security** (like the famous "OWASP Top 10" list) [6].
*   **Rules of Engagement (RoE):** A document that sets the legal boundaries, scope, and rules for a pen test to prevent service crashes [7, 8].

### **Part 2: Medium Answers (5-Mark Style)**

These provide more detail and context for major topics.

#### **1. The 5 Phases of Ethical Hacking**
Ethical hacking follows a specific lifecycle to ensure it is thorough [7]:
*   **Reconnaissance (Footprinting):** Gathering as much info as possible about the target using tools like Google or pings [9].
*   **Scanning & Enumeration:** Identifying live systems, open ports, and specific user accounts [9].
*   **Gaining Access:** This is the actual **exploitation** where the hacker uses tools like SQL injection or password cracking to get in [9].
*   **Maintaining Access:** The hacker tries to stay inside the system (using backdoors) to see how much damage could be done [9, 10].
*   **Reporting:** Instead of hiding tracks like a criminal, the ethical hacker documents everything and provides a report on how to fix the issues [10].

#### **2. Categories of Penetration Testing**
Tests are grouped by how much the tester knows and what they are targeting [11]:
*   **Knowledge-Based:** **Black Box** (tester knows nothing, simulates a real external attack), **White Box** (tester knows everything), and **Grey Box** (tester has partial info, like a normal user login) [11-13].
*   **Area-Based:** **Network testing** (firewalls and ports), **Web Application testing** (websites), **Social Engineering** (tricking people), and **Wireless/Mobile testing** (Wi-Fi and apps) [13, 14].

#### **3. Penetration Testing Methodologies**
Standard frameworks help keep testing professional and scientific [15]:
*   **OSSTMM:** Focuses on scientific metrics and operational security across physical and human areas [15].
*   **OWASP:** The "gold standard" specifically for testing **web applications** [15, 16].
*   **NIST:** A risk-based framework often used by government and large enterprise organizations [16].
*   **PTES:** A comprehensive industry standard that covers the entire lifecycle from pre-engagement to reporting [16].

#### **4. The Role of Rules of Engagement (RoE)**
The **RoE** is the most important document before a test begins because it ensures the process is **safe and legal** [8, 17]:
*   **Scope:** Clearly lists which systems can and cannot be touched [18].
*   **Legal Protection:** Provides written permission so the tester isn't treated as a criminal [18].
*   **Boundaries:** Lists forbidden techniques (like DoS) to ensure the business keeps running [18].
*   **Communication:** Provides a list of contacts in case a server accidentally crashes during the test [19].

#### **5. Types of Hackers and Their Roles**
Hackers are categorized by their intent and the legality of their actions [17]:
*   **White Hats:** Ethical hackers who work legally to strengthen security [17].
*   **Black Hats:** Malicious hackers who steal data or cause damage for personal gain [20].
*   **Grey Hats:** They find bugs without permission but usually report them; they operate in a legal "grey area" [20, 21].
*   **Hacktivists:** People who hack for political or social causes, like protesting government policies [21, 22].
*   **Insider Hackers:** The most dangerous type—employees or former employees who misuse their authorized access to steal or sabotage [22].
