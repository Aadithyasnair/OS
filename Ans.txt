Here are the checked answers from your sources, condensed for the 2-mark questions and simplified for the 5-mark questions.

### **Part A: 2-Mark Questions (Concise Answers)**

1.  **Define OS services:** These are services the OS provides to programs and users to ensure tasks run conveniently and efficiently [1].
2.  **List two goals of an OS:** To ensure the **efficient use** of the computer and provide **user convenience** [1].
3.  **System programs vs. System calls:** System programs provide an environment for **running and developing programs**, while system calls are the **interface** used to access the OS kernel [1].
4.  **Role of the command interpreter:** It acts as an interface that **interprets user commands** and tells the kernel to execute them [2].
5.  **Two OS services:** **Program execution** and **I/O operations** [2].
6.  **Linker vs. Loader:** A **linker** combines object modules into one executable file; a **loader** places that file into **main memory** to start it [2].
7.  **Two process execution operations:** **Creation/deletion** of processes and handling **synchronization/communication** [3].
8.  **Two types of system programs:** **File management** (creating/deleting files) and **Programming-language support** (compilers/debuggers) [3].
9.  **What is the kernel?** It is the **core part** of the OS that sits between the hardware and the system-call interface, handling CPU and memory tasks [3, 4].
10. **Open-source OS:** An OS where users can **view and change the source code**, such as **Linux** [4].
11. **Context switching:** The process of **switching the CPU** from one process to another during multitasking [4].
12. **Define kernel:** The central core of the OS that manages hardware and system calls [4, 5].
13. **Roles of a loader:** It performs **loading** (allocating memory), **linking**, and **relocation** [5].
14. **Communication with OS:** User programs talk to the OS using **system calls** [5].
15. **4 types of computer systems:** Stand-alone systems, terminals, workstations, and handheld devices [5, 6].

### **Part B: 5-Mark Questions (Simplified Explanations)**

**1. Absolute Loader vs. Re-locatable Loader**
*   **Absolute Loader:** The programmer sets a **fixed memory address** beforehand [6]. The loader simply places the program exactly in that spot and starts it [6]. It is simple but inflexible because you can't easily use libraries with fixed addresses [6, 7].
*   **Re-locatable Loader:** The loader finds **any available space** in memory at "load time" [7]. It modifies the program's addresses so it can run from that new location [8]. This is much more efficient for running multiple programs at once [7, 8].

**2. Static Linker vs. Dynamic Linker**
*   **Static Linker:** Linking happens **before the program runs** (during compilation) [8, 9]. It copies all needed library code into the final executable file [9]. This makes the file larger but very portable since it doesn't need external libraries later [9, 10].
*   **Dynamic Linker:** Linking happens **at run time** [10]. Multiple programs share one copy of a library in memory, which **saves disk and RAM space** [10]. However, if the required library is missing from the system, the program won't run [11].

**3. Major Functions of an OS**
The OS manages the computer through seven main roles:
1.  **Process Management:** Creating, running, and stopping processes [11, 12].
2.  **Memory Management:** Tracking and allocating RAM to different programs [12].
3.  **File System:** Organizing how files are created, stored, and protected [13].
4.  **I/O Management:** Managing devices like keyboards and printers using drivers [13, 14].
5.  **Secondary Storage:** Managing disk space and scheduling how data is written [14].
6.  **Security:** Protecting the system from unauthorized users via passwords and encryption [14, 15].
7.  **User Interface:** Providing a way for users to interact, like a CLI (text) or GUI (windows) [15].

**4. Working of Loaders**
A loader takes a program that has been translated and gets it ready to run in three steps [16]:
1.  **Loading:** It allocates space in the main memory and moves the program instructions there [16].
2.  **Linking:** It connects different pieces of the program together so they can work as one [17].
3.  **Relocation:** It updates the program's memory addresses so it fits into the current available spot in RAM [17].
*(Visual flow: Source Program → Translator → Object Program → Loader → Main Memory)* [17].

**5. Concept of System Calls**
System calls are the **bridge** between a program and the OS kernel [18]. 
*   **How they work:** When a program needs a service (like reading a file), it makes a system call [19].
*   **Mode Switch:** The CPU switches from **User Mode** to **Kernel Mode** to perform the task safely [19, 20].
*   **APIs:** Most programmers use **APIs** (like Win32 for Windows or POSIX for Linux) instead of calling the kernel directly [19].

**6. Operating System Structures**
*   **Simple (MS-DOS):** Not divided into modules; everything is mixed together to save space [21].
*   **Non-Simple (UNIX):** Divided into two parts: system programs and the core kernel [21].
*   **Layered:** The OS is built like a cake; each layer only talks to the one directly below it [22].
*   **Microkernel:** Moves most tasks out of the kernel into "user space" [22]. This makes the system more **secure and stable**, though slightly slower due to extra communication [23].
